CheesePress Framework
=====================

This is a general purpose framework to develop WordPress plugins. It is Inspired by Churro, WP Boilerplate, and PHP ActiveRecord.  

#Installation - Without Composer

2. Replace all references to CheesePress Framework with your plugin name (unless you want to give me credit for your plugin)
3. Upload and Activate the plugin at the plugin administration page
4. There is no step 4 -- you are done! Be Creative!
